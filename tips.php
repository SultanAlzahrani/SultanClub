      <h3 class="section-title">Tips for Getting Into Web Development</h3>
      <p class="section-paragraph">If you’re just starting out or thinking about diving into web development, here are some useful tips to guide your learning journey and avoid common pitfalls:</p>

      <ul class="tips-list">
        <li class="tip-item"><strong>Start with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:</strong> These are the core building blocks of the web. Learn how websites are structured (HTML), styled (CSS), and made interactive (JavaScript).</li>
        <li class="tip-item"><strong>Don’t wait to build things:</strong> Even small projects like a personal homepage, to-do list app, or portfolio site are great ways to apply what you're learning.</li>
        <li class="tip-item"><strong>Version control is a must:</strong> Learn how to use Git and GitHub. It helps you track your progress and share code professionally.</li>
        <li class="tip-item"><strong>Understand how the web works:</strong> Learn the basics of HTTP, how browsers request content, and what servers do. It’ll make debugging way easier later on.</li>
        <li class="tip-item"><strong>Pick one backend language:</strong> Whether it’s PHP, Node.js, Python, or Ruby, start with one and learn how to connect it with a database like MySQL or MongoDB.</li>
        <li class="tip-item"><strong>Get familiar with responsive design:</strong> Mobile-first websites are standard today. Learn how to use media queries and flexible layouts.</li>
        <li class="tip-item"><strong>Use online resources:</strong> FreeCodeCamp, MDN Web Docs, W3Schools, and YouTube tutorials are great places to learn by doing.</li>
        <li class="tip-item"><strong>Join a community:</strong> Reddit, Discord servers, Stack Overflow, or local dev groups can provide support, code reviews, and opportunities to learn faster.</li>
        <li class="tip-item"><strong>Stay consistent:</strong> Coding every day—even just 30 minutes—builds momentum. Don’t stress if things feel hard at first; that’s totally normal.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="section-paragraph">Most importantly, be patient with yourself. Learning to code isn’t just about memorizing syntax—it’s about problem-solving, building cool things, and growing over time. Everyone starts somewhere, and the best way to improve is to keep experimenting, failing, learning, and building.</p>
